description: Diagnose and fix a failing slopstopper check, including a check that doesn't apply to the repo's shape (a browser check on an API or library). Use when a user reports a specific slopstopper workflow or task is failing: SAST, secrets, complexity, docs-accuracy, docs-size, docs-structure, entry-files, CSP exceptions, auto-label, smoke, E2E, accessibility, Core Web Vitals, SEO, broken links, DAST, dependency review, API health, API latency, OpenAPI drift, API headers/CORS, or the workflow-failure tracker. Maps each check to the local task that reproduces it, the report files it generates, the typical root-cause categories (real finding / false positive / threshold too tight), and a per-symptom gotcha table with diagnostic steps and the file the fix lives in. For first-time install OR refreshing an existing install use slopstopper-install.

# Triage a failing slopstopper check

You're being asked to fix a slopstopper check that's failing. This skill is reactive. It assumes the install is in place and at least one check is red. If the user is mid-install, `slopstopper-install` Step 7 handed off here; the procedure is the same.

Every check runs through `slopstopper-cli`: each `ss-*.yml` workflow is `uses: ./.github/actions/ss-setup`, then `slopstopper run <category>:<check>`, then `slopstopper emit … --target {pr-comment,issue}`. URL-driven checks add `uses: ./.github/actions/ss-resolve-url`, which turns the event into the URL to audit. If a check ran against the wrong URL, that action's table is the first place to look. So the local reproducer is always `slopstopper run …` (or its `task ss:*` shim).

This file is the map. The long tables live in `references/` and are **read only when a step needs them**, so the whole skill costs one page of context until then.

The shape of the fix is one of three things:

1. **A real finding.** The check is right and the code is wrong. Fix the code.
2. **A false positive.** The heuristic misfires on this codebase. Suppress narrowly via the check's documented mechanism, always with a `# why` comment.
3. **A threshold too tight for this repo.** The check is correct but its config isn't. Tune in `.slopstopper.yml`.

Don't apply blanket suppressions and don't loosen thresholds without writing down why.

## Step 1: Identify which check is failing

Slopstopper workflows follow the naming pattern `ss-<loop>-<action>-check.yml`. Decode:

- **`<loop>`** = `security`, `hygiene`, `reliability` → maps to `docs/<loop>/README.md` for the loop-level overview.
- **`<action>`** = `sast`, `secrets`, `complexity`, `docs-accuracy`, etc. → maps to a specific check name `<loop>:<action>` in the CLI's `REGISTRY` (`cli/slopstopper/checks/__init__.py`).

If the user only gave you the workflow URL or a failing CI badge, click through to the workflow file under `.github/workflows/` in the target repo and read the `run:` step. Task-mode workflows call `task ss:<category>:<check>`, and `--no-task` mode workflows call `slopstopper run <category>:<check>` directly. Either way the check name is the same one you use locally.

### Fastest route: read the PR summary comment

Every PR carries one rolling comment headed `SlopStopper: N of M checks failed`, with the failures in a table linking straight to their logs, and the passing checks folded below. Start there: it names the failing checks and nothing else, so you don't have to scan the Actions tab or 20 comment cards.

Each failing check also posts its own compact comment, with a verdict line, the failing items, and the full report folded into a `<details>`. Open that fold before pulling the artifact: it is the same report, already on the page.

A `⚠️` verdict is neither. The advisory checks (`hygiene:docs-size`) report findings while deliberately exiting 0, so they post `⚠️ …: has alerts` and keep the comment. The job is green and the summary shows ✅, because the alert is a nudge rather than a gate.

**A green PR has no per-check comments at all.** Passing checks delete theirs (`emit --on-pass=delete`), so the summary is the only comment. An absent comment means "passed", not "didn't run". The summary's own table is what distinguishes those.


## Step 2: Reproduce locally

Every workflow has a `task ss:<category>:<check>` shim and a `slopstopper run <category>:<check>` form; dynamic checks take the URL as a bare positional after `--`. The browser checks build and serve the repo on `localhost:8080`; the four API checks and `hygiene:openapi` never build locally, so reproduce them against the environment CI audited. `reliability:api-latency` does not reproduce reliably anywhere; re-run it in the same environment a few times before believing one result.

The full workflow → task → CLI table, with the URL / local-build / Docker columns, is in **`references/reproduce.md`**.

## Step 3: Read the report

Most checks write structured output under `.ss/reports/<check>/`:

- `.ss/reports/<check>/<check>-report.md` is human-readable and the one you want first.
- `.ss/reports/<check>/<check>-report.json` is machine-readable, useful for grep / jq.

For DAST: `.ss/reports/dast/dast-report.json` + `.ss/reports/dast/dast-report.md` + `.ss/reports/dast/dast-gate.json` (the swallow-vs-block decisions the gate made, with `source` field naming which exception mechanism let each one through).

For Playwright: `playwright-report/` at the target repo root (Playwright's own HTML report).

Read the report before deciding the fix shape. Most reports name the file, line, rule, and severity, which collapses Step 4 immediately.


## Step 4: Categorise the finding

Real finding → fix the code. False positive → the check's own suppression mechanism (`.gitleaks.toml`, `# nosemgrep`, `.zap/rules.tsv`, `.trivyignore`, `docs/security/CSP_EXCEPTIONS.md`…), narrowly, with `# why`. Threshold → the matching `.slopstopper.yml` knob (`hygiene.complexity.max_ccn`, `hygiene.docs_size.*`, `hygiene.entry_files.*`, `api.*`, `security.sast.fail_on`…).

The suppression table and the config-driven-knob table are in **`references/categorise.md`**.

## Step 5: Per-symptom gotcha table

Once you know the symptom, look it up before reasoning from scratch: **`references/gotchas.md`** maps each one (a browser check red on an API repo, a check green in Actions but its comment says failed, DAST reporting nothing against an API, `api-latency` failing in CI and passing locally, exit `2` with no findings…) to the diagnostic step, the root cause, the fix, and the file it lives in.

## Steps 6–7: Broader fixes, and deleting the check instead

When the failing check is really a symptom of the repo's shape (wrong profile, no AGENTS.md-first docs layout, no headers source), fix the shape. When a check genuinely does not apply, delete it deliberately, through `workflows.disabled` or the profile, never a silent workflow deletion. **`references/broader-fixes.md`** covers both, including which checks are safe to drop and which never are.

## When to hand off

- **First-time install** on a new repo → `slopstopper-install` (you're here because that skill handed off mid-install, so go back when this check is green).
- **Refreshing an existing install** → `slopstopper-install`; its refresh section is the mechanical "re-run installer + re-apply customizations" loop. A check that is new since the last refresh is still this skill's job.

Anything that changes slopstopper itself needs a matching edit here or the tables rot. **`references/maintaining.md`** lists the triggers.
